## Temple University Criminal Justice Training Programs
Criminal Justice Training Programs, a division of the Temple University Department of Criminal Justice, is an interdisciplinary unit that has conducted professional development programs for a variety of criminal justice agencies and occupations since 1968. Today, over 3,000 criminal justice professionals attend programs offered by CJTP each year including police officers, deputy sheriffs, state constables, legislative security officers, magisterial district court staff, school resource officers, park rangers, and crime prevention specialists. Other activities include continuing education programs for agencies allied to the criminal justice system, and the development of curricula including distance-learning. For the latest news and developments, please see the announcements below.

## New CJTP Course Offering

### Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program Update<br>
**The National Park Service has officially changed the name of the Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program or S.L.E.T.P to Park Ranger Law Enforcement Academy or PRLEA. There are no changes to the academy, same requirements, same number of training hours, same curriculum.** It will take some time to make the name change on digital media, paperwork, applications etc. Please be patient while we make these updates.  The Park Service also introduced a new academy emblem to reflect the name change. 

_If you have any questions, please contact Assistant Director Willard at [cwillard@temple.edu](mailto:cwillard@temple.edu)_.
