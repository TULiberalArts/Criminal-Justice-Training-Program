## Police Officers' In-Service Training for 2018
Temple University is pleased to announce the Police Officers' In-Service Training (Act 180) program offered through the Temple University Police Academy. Classes are offered at the Bucks County Police Training Center in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

**All Certified Municipal Police Officers must complete a minimum of 12 hours of approved in-service training from January 1 – December 31, 2018 that includes REQUIRED courses. The balance (9 hours) can consist of the approved optional courses listed below or on the list of MPOETC Approved CLEE Courses.**

## 2018 Course Descriptions
**18-001 Legal Updates (Required course)** - A three-hour course to discuss significant pieces of legislation passed after July 1, 2016 that affect police operations and investigations, specifically changes and updates to the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, Vehicle Code, and Rules of Criminal Procedure. The training program also addresses pertinent court decisions from the Pennsylvania Commonwealth, Superior and Supreme Courts, and the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts and explains legal issues directly impacting police procedures and the case preparation process.

**18-002 PJ Tactics and De-escalation Techniques (Optional)** - A three-hour course to build on the core concepts of procedural justice and police legitimacy taught in 2017 Procedural Justice (PJ) that teach officers specific tactics and deescalation techniques that support these concepts. Much of the material is drawn from existing courses such as Philadelphia’s De-Escalation Techniques and Pittsburgh’s Procedural Justice Tactical Legitimacy. Although optional, the course builds on the material taught to all officers in 2017 and provides more specific guidance and recommendations to officers facing a multitude of challenging situations. The end goal, as with 2017 PJ, is to teach officers how to build respectful and effective relationships with the community while improving officer safety.

**18-003 Assessing and Planning for Active Assaults (Optional)** - A three-hour course intended to develop police officers ability to assist various community entities wishing to prepare for, prevent, and respond to active assaults. The intent of this training is not to replace other law enforcement active assault training but rather to bridge the gap between knowing how to respond as an officer and knowing how to assist in the development of active assault response plans in schools, businesses, etc. throughout the community. Training prepares officers to understand and conduct assessments, articulate the various first responder roles, and assist in the development of appropriate prevention and response plans.

**18-004 Officer Safety - Detecting and Avoiding Ambush Situations (Optional)** - A three-hour course to address office safety issues related to ambushes. Appropriate tactics, techniques, and procedures are discussed related to the full spectrum of officer interaction with the public. Specific focus is placed on identifying and detecting indicators of planned ambushes as well as identifying situations that lend themselves to spontaneous ambushes. Emphasis on the role of officer complacency during routine activities as well as discussions of effective responses during ambush situations round out the course.
